Ahoy!

It appears you have found a new blog. You can learn more about me [here](/about/). My plan for this website is to share my activity, notes and contributions with the opensource community that has supported me so much in the beginings on my career.

Additionally, this is my first real foray into static sites (thanks [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)). Please feel free to leave a comment or alternatively if your not a fan of Disqus and/or Google Analytics feel free to use NoScript or similarly draconian browser configuration.
