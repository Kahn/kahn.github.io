Ahoy!

Its been a while and a lot has happened over the last few months. Of particular note is that the **Cloudrouter.org** team at [IIX](http://www.iixpeering.net/) launched their public beta on the 31st of March!

Head over to [https://cloudrouter.org/](https://cloudrouter.org/) to check out the latest on the project.

For those of you this side of the ditch, I have created a quick [script](https://github.com/Kahn/scripts/blob/master/mirror.sh) to drag a copy of the repository to Brisbane. Your mirror link is [http://repo.cycloptivity.net/cloudrouter.org/](http://repo.cycloptivity.net/cloudrouter.org/).

Personally, I plan in letting a few of these routers loose in DN42 over the coming months!
