While using just a few nodes for DN42 has been I thought for fun I would deploy a few more POP's around the world (The [HE IPv6 video](http://youtu.be/Q65QuB1CXis) on sparse allocation might have helped!).

As such I introduce a number of new changes. I've extended my dn42.cycloptivity.net sub domain to include a country code for each node.

- au01.dn42.cycloptivity.net - Aspley, Queensland

    My residential crappy ADSL2+ tail with routing via Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite. Currently blazes at 6/0.8Mbps. Eventually will move to a FTTH 100/40 service and host AU services for DN42. In the meantime au01.dn42.cycloptivity.net will **no longer provide transit**. Future nodes may include a Cisco 877 and Juniper SRX110 once bandwidth improves.

- au02.dn42.cycloptivity.net - Brisbane, Queensland

Currently the last remaing POP to go live will be **jp01**. All other nodes are already alive and able to provide transit (albiet sub-optimal in some cases).

I've created a breif diagram showing average RTT between each node.

![CYCLOPTIVITY-DN42](http://http://www.cycloptivity.net/images/cycloptivity-dn42.png)

I am starting to make use of the [phpipam](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpipam/) tool to track address usage.

```
CYCLOPTIVITY-DN42 (172.23.161.0/25) has 4 directly nested subnets:

Subnet description	    Subnet	          Used	% Free	
au02.cycloptivity.dn42	172.23.161.0/27	 11/30   63.33		
jp01.cycloptivity.dn42	172.23.161.32/27	0/30	100		
us01.cycloptivity.dn42	172.23.161.64/27	2/30	93.33		
de01.cycloptivity.dn42	172.23.161.96/27	1/30	96.67	
```

Hopefully, I can make use of the phpipam API to create a automatic rdns tool. Tracking all the various interfaces is getting fairly tedious!

Thats all for now! If your interested in this sort of shenanigans please visit [dn42.net](http://dn42.net)!
