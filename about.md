I am Sam Wilson, a geek at heart and a part of the sys admin profession. I've specialised with Redhat Enterprise Linux and have continued to develop my skills across other platforms including other *nix'es, OSX, Windows and SmartOS / Illumos. I tend to be that SELinux guy in the teams I work with. I generally have a fairly paranoid security background after spending some time as a infosec consultant.

When I am not spending time with my beautiful wife, [fixing something](../images/geek.png) or indulging in my steam library you may find my on a push bike.
